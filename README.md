# SVCE Website Clone
 
This project marked the beginning of my full-stack development journey.
As a faithful recreation of my college website, it served as a foundational experience in honing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
While relatively simple in scope, this project provided invaluable insights into crafting user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces, laying the groundwork for more complex endeavours.
